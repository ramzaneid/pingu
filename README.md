Masha

A sculpture of Masha and The Bear along with their friend Hare in Yelan.
Masha (a diminutive form of Maria) is a 4-year-old girl who is portrayed as naughty and hyperactive, and always thinks about playing. She lives in a house near a railway station; near her house there is a path that leads to the Bear's house. Masha loves the bear very much, but in her games she tends to create problems for him. In the series, neither Masha's parents nor the parents of her friends are shown. She loves sweets, jumping in a bucket, and looking at drawings of her and Bear. Masha's character combines the characteristics of 4-year-old (making grammatical errors when speaking, crying when she is not given what she wants) with adult skills (playing tennis, fishing, making preserves, playing electric guitar and throwing tantrums). In the episode "God Save the Queen", it is revealed that Masha has super strength, as she managed to pull a multi-ton train near her house just to give an elegant reception for the Lion King. She is voiced by Alina Kukushkina in Russian, and in English by Elsie Fisher.[5] In subsequent seasons, Masha was dubbed by Rebecca Bloom (ep. 27–39), Angelica Keamy (ep. 40–52), Giulia De Carvalho (53-91), and now dubbed by Kaitlyn McCormick. She is usually shown wearing a white shirt under a purple dress with a purple hood covering her short hair.



Bear
The bear is a retired circus Kamchatka brown bear who lives in a house hollowed out of a tree in the forest. His past occupation makes him very talented in performing arts (like juggling, unicycling, and even stage magic) although he's also known to dabble into other hobbies and even some intellectual pursuits. Some episodes feature flashbacks in which he remembers his childhood as a cub in the same house. In the Russian-language version, Masha calls him "Mishka" (Russian: Мишка, a diminutive form of Russian name Misha, lit. "Mikey", fig. "Little Bear"), the traditional name given to bears in Russian tales. He is a huge bear with a big heart and he is Masha's father-like figure, as well as a friendly figure to her. He was voiced by Boris Kutnevich & Irina Kukushkina. He earlier also resided in Moscow.
